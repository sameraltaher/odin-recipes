<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Mujadara is a healthy, inexpensive vegan dish that is popular in the Arab cuisines. Its base ingredients are rice and brown lentils. The star ingredient is the crispy fried onion; it makes the dish! The coriander which is added as a garnish also adds a blast of flavor.</p>
<p>We will be working with the basic Levant version of Mujadara, which, unlike the North-African versions (sometimes referred to as <em>Kushari</em>), excludes elbow pasta and any kind of tomato-based sauce. This recipe can be prepared with much ease and very quickly, so let's get started!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup white rice (Basmati or any long-grain)</li>
    <li>1 cup brown or green lentils (do not use red or yellow lentils! They will not hold well.)</li>

    <li>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 bunch coriander</li>
    <li>3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cups water</li>
    <li> <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tbsp sea salt</li>
