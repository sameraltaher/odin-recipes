<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A dangerously delicious, decadent, grilled cheese sandwich with tangy, sweet, and savory flavors smashing up against each other. This filling sandwich can be quickly prepared and will satisfy almost any level of hunger being experienced during meal times. In fact, many a people would whole-heartedly agree to eat this thing for breakfast giving it the trifecta label that only a special few foods (feta cheese spinach mushroom omelette, anyone?) are known for.</p>
<p>Aside from tasting absolutely delicious, Kimchi is loaded with fiber and pro-biotics that will help keep you as regular as your morning cup o' joe. All these ingredients are regularly available at most grocers and will most definitely be found at your local Wholefoods.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<!--Need help increasing line heigh in the list to accommodate for the fractions.-->

<ul>
    <li>4 slices of sandwich bread</li>
    <li>2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tablespoons butter at room temperature</li>
    <li> <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> cup shredded extra sharp white cheddar cheese</li>
    <li> <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup kimchi, chopped</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons chopped scallions</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon gochujang</li>
    <li>1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoons honey</li>
    <li> <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> teaspoon sesame oil</li>
    <li>1 large avocado</li>
    <li>1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tablespoons lime juice</li>
    <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teaspoon salt</li>

</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<em>Prep time</em>: 8 minutes
<br> <em>Cook time</em>: 8 - 10 minutes </br>

<ol>
    <li>Spread a thin layer of butter over one side of each slice of bread.</li>
    <li>Turn 2 slices of bread over so that the buttered side is facing down. Divide the shredded cheese between these slices of bread.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, mix the chopped kimchi, scallions, gochujang, honey, and sesame oil.</li>
    <li>In another bowl, mash the avocado. Mix in the lime juice, garlic powder, and salt.</li>
    <li>Divide the kimchi over the slices of bread that are topped with cheese. </li>
    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. You may need to adjust the heat higher or lower depending on your stove. Carefully place the 2 prepared slices of bread with cheese and kimchi into the skillet. Cover the skillet and cook until the cheese is melted, about 3 to 4 minutes.
    Carefully divide the mashed avocado over the remaining slices of bread. Don't worry too much about having to spread the avocado all the way to the edges. The mash spreads out when you flip the sandwich over. </li>
    <li>Top both sandwiches with the remaining slices of bread, avocado side down and buttered side up. Gently press down on the top slices of bread to adhere the bread to the rest of the sandwich. Using a large spatula, carefully flip both sandwiches over and cook the other side until the bread is toasted, another 2 to 3 minutes, uncovered. Transfer the sandwiches to a plate and serve immediately.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
